Well, it’s official. I just wrapped up my first week as a Software Engineer on The Design System team at Travelers. And honestly? It’s been an awesome start.

Right out of the gate, setting up my local dev environment was a breeze. It was the fastest I’ve ever gotten a project running at a new company. No endless meetings or tangled configurations. Just a quick setup and I was off and running.

On day three we had Employee Day. They pulled out all the stops. Live music, food, mini golf, and plenty of fun. It felt like a festival and was such a great way to jump into the company culture.

Corporate training is usually the part I dread the most. Hours of dry slides and quizzes that test your patience. But this time around, it was easy. Everything was clear, straightforward, and actually helpful.

And the team? Couldn’t ask for a better group. Laid-back, genuinely excited about the work we’re doing, and always ready to lend a hand. That’s a huge win in my book.

Oh, and the cafeteria. I’ve never seen anything like it. Sushi, wood-fired pizza, Starbucks, UCONN ice cream, a main line with rotating specials, sandwiches, burgers, and a salad bar that’s probably bigger than my living room. I might need to schedule some extra steps in my day just to balance it all out.

I could go on and on, but I’ll save some details for another time. For now, I’m feeling grateful and excited to be here. Can’t wait to see what’s next.
