I once had a drum teacher tell me I had "too much of a student mindset." At the time, I wasn't sure what to make of it. Wasn't being a student a good thing? I was there to learn. I wanted to improve. It seemed like the whole point.

But the way he said it, the way he emphasized <em>too much</em>, stuck with me. He wasn't criticizing my effort. He was hinting at something else. Something about mindset, not just skill level. And lately, I've been thinking about how that comment applies to my career, too.

## The Pros of the Student Mindset

First, let's be clear: The student mindset has been one of the best tools I've ever carried. It's kept me curious in a field that changes constantly. It's made me more adaptable when new tools, frameworks, and best practices show up out of nowhere. It's made me easier to work with, because I'm not precious about my ideas. I'm happy to learn from others. It's made me better at asking good questions, not just trying to look smart. It's helped me stay grounded, even as my skills have grown.

When you treat yourself like a student, there's always more to learn. That's a powerful thing in an industry where standing still is falling behind.

## The Challenges of the Student Mindset

That said, carrying a student mindset into a career isn't without its trade-offs. Sometimes, it's easy to stay in "learning mode" longer than necessary. To hesitate a little too much before trusting your own judgment. To assume that someone else must know better, even when you actually have a solid, informed take.

Sometimes the student mindset can slow you down, not because you don't know enough, but because you keep waiting to know even more before acting. In certain moments, I've realized that it's not just about gathering information. It's about making decisions, moving projects forward, and trusting the experience I've built over time.

That doesn't mean abandoning the student mindset. It just means balancing it with a willingness to act, even when you know you still have more to learn.

## Where I've Landed

When I think back to what my teacher said, I don't see it as a critique anymore.
I see it as a reminder: Learning is powerful. But so is stepping forward and trusting what you already know.

I'm still proud to have a student mindset. I still seek out mentors, trusted peers, and better ways of doing things. (Heck, even the President has advisors.) Being a student isn't something you outgrow. It's something you carry with you, the same way you carry curiosity and humility.

But experience has taught me that sometimes you also need to lean into the role of builder, problem-solver, decision-maker, even while you're still learning. You don't have to "graduate" to be ready. You just have to be willing to move forward, learn on your feet, and keep reaching for better. And honestly, I wouldn't want it any other way.
