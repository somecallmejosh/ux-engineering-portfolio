During my time at America’s Test Kitchen (ATK), <strong>I found myself at the center of a wide range of projects that tested my expertise in web application design and front-end development</strong>. ATK’s mission has always been about great content—recipes, cooking techniques, and product reviews—and my role was to ensure that the digital experience behind this content was just as robust as the recipes themselves.

## Designing a Custom CMS: Barista
One of the most significant hurdles I encountered revolved around the editorial team’s content production workflow. They relied heavily on our engineering group for updates, slowing down the entire process of getting fresh content to our audience. Recognizing how this dependency could hamper ATK’s growth, I began laying the groundwork for a custom content management system, which we eventually called “Barista.”

Barista was born out of extensive conversations with editors, project managers, and developers. <strong>I wanted to create a system that not only streamlined the editorial workflow but also empowered the team to push updates without constant engineering support</strong>. By focusing on intuitive design choices—like simplified navigation and clear content organization—I ensured that even team members less familiar with tech tools could adapt quickly. <strong>The day we launched Barista, our editorial team immediately shaved hours off their regular content updates</strong>, dramatically speeding up how fast our latest recipes and product reviews reached our audience.

## Fostering Usability and Consistency
Once Barista was in use, I noticed something else: the learning curve was still steep for some team members. Editors would occasionally stumble across features or struggle to find specific templates. Instead of patching these issues with quick fixes, I doubled down on user feedback. <strong>I set up regular check-ins where editors could openly share what worked and what didn’t</strong>. Armed with these insights, I refined the interface to align better with the team’s actual workflow.

These refinements might seem like small tweaks—moving a button here, renaming a dropdown there—but the cumulative effect was powerful. <strong>Over a few design sprints, Barista felt less like a new tool being forced on the team and more like a natural extension of how the editorial process should flow</strong>. That sense of comfort and consistency lifted the team’s confidence in using Barista, allowing them to experiment with fresh content ideas more freely.

## Making Accessibility a Priority
Meanwhile, ensuring everyone could use Barista seamlessly—regardless of ability—rose to the top of my priority list. While accessibility often gets pushed aside in the rush to deliver new features, I saw it as a central pillar of good user experience. Working closely with QA testers and accessibility advocates, I analyzed the platform’s color contrasts, heading structures, and keyboard navigation.

## Building Reusable Components for Multiple Brands
ATK isn’t just a single brand; it’s an umbrella for diverse cooking shows (at least at the time of my employment with them it was), magazines, and websites. That meant our digital tools needed to work across different platforms and styles, all while preserving brand coherence. I joined forces with our design and marketing teams to craft a set of reusable components that could easily be dropped into various projects.

Being a <a href="https://react.dev" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">React</a> shop, we leveraged the power of component-based architecture using <a href="https://nextjs.org">NextJs</a> to create a library of UI elements that could be shared across different brands. This library included everything from buttons and form fields to more complex components like carousels and modals. This was crucial for ATK, where the audience might jump from one brand to another without realizing it. <strong>We wanted to make sure that the transition felt seamless, even if the underlying technology was different</strong>.

It might sound tricky, but by thoughtfully separating style layers from core functionality, we managed to keep designs flexible. This approach saved valuable time: <strong>instead of coding new features from scratch for each property, we could build once and adapt at will</strong>. It also cut down on inconsistencies—a subtle color mismatch or a missing button style was easy to spot and fix in one place.

## Documenting in Storybook for Accessibility and Transparency
Another challenge came after we’d developed this ever-growing library of components. <strong>Teams needed a reliable resource to understand how each component worked, when to use it, and how to keep everything accessible. That’s where Storybook came in handy.</strong> Collaborating with QA and fellow engineers, I documented each component’s functionality, intended use cases, and relevant accessibility standards.

This proved invaluable not just for developers, but for designers and even marketing folks who wanted a peek under the hood. <strong>If someone needed a form widget that could handle various input types, they could check Storybook and immediately see examples of how it behaved.</strong> This level of transparency accelerated our development cycle and laid out a clear path for future enhancements.

## The Impact: Strengthening the Digital Foundations
Reflecting on my time at America’s Test Kitchen, I can’t help but feel proud of how these initiatives came together to form a solid digital backbone for a much-loved brand. By empowering the editorial team with Barista, prioritizing usability, and weaving accessibility into the fabric of our platform, we made it easier for everyone—internal teams and the audience alike—to enjoy and contribute to ATK’s culinary adventures.

Perhaps the greatest lesson I took away from this journey was the value of collaboration. <strong>None of these accomplishments would have been possible without the editors who spoke up about their challenges, the designers who iterated alongside me, or the marketing teams who championed the end-user experience.</strong> Together, we created a more efficient, inclusive, and user-friendly environment that continues to serve as a launchpad for future growth at ATK.
