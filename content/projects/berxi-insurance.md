When I joined <a href="https://www.berxi.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Berxi.com, a Berkshire Hathaway Specialty Insurance venture</a>, my mission was clear: craft a user experience that blended cutting-edge design with the practical needs of a growing insurance platform. As the principal design engineer, I knew this wasn’t just about making things look pretty—<strong>it was about solving real problems for the business, enabling the marketing team, and giving developers the right tools to innovate</strong>. Over time, we created a bespoke design system that dramatically elevated usability, accessibility, and brand cohesion, reshaping the way Berxi.com approached digital product development.

## Finding the Right Balance for Stakeholders
Before diving into code, <strong>I spent weeks meeting with our developers, user researchers, marketing experts, and product managers</strong>. Each department had a unique perspective on what a new design system should accomplish. The dev team wanted something lightweight, scalable, and easy to maintain. Marketing needed consistent branding to support campaigns. Executives wanted agility and a fast return on investment. I remember one conversation with a senior product manager who worried that tinkering with the website’s core might introduce risks. But after hashing out concerns, we found that by aligning the design system with solid technologies—Tailwind CSS and Vue.js—we could achieve the flexibility everyone needed.

## Tailwind CSS & Vue.js: The Foundation
In choosing <a href="https://tailwindcss.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Tailwind CSS</a>, I aimed for a utility-first framework that gave developers confidence and speed. With <a href="https://vuejs.org" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Vue.js</a>, we could build dynamic components that matched Berxi’s growing feature set. Pairing these technologies felt natural; the developer team quickly embraced the approach, excited by the clear documentation and the potential for rapid, consistent iteration.

## Crafting a Developer-Friendly Tech Stack
During this process, the question of “which tools best support our evolving needs?” kept surfacing. <strong>We evaluated a dozen options, but our top priority was ensuring developers spent more time building great features instead of fighting the framework</strong>. Vue.js offered a gentle learning curve, Tailwind provided a design language that was both flexible and expressive, and the combination lent itself to high accessibility standards—a non-negotiable for us.

I recall a pair programming session with a colleague who had never touched Tailwind before. In under an hour, they felt comfortable modifying layouts and adjusting spacing—no fuss, no friction. This moment exemplified why these tools were the right choice: they not only accelerated development but also freed us to focus on finer design details that truly mattered to end users.

## Bridging Marketing and Backend
Although design systems often live in the front-end realm, <strong>one of my goals was to ensure our marketing team and backend developers felt fully supported</strong>. In the early stages, marketing campaigns sometimes clashed with ongoing back-end work, leading to last-minute style changes or broken layouts. By establishing a close partnership with both teams, we devised a workflow where everyone shared a single source of design truth—no more guesswork about fonts, colors, or spacing.

We held <strong>bi-weekly “sync sessions” where designers would present updates, marketing would discuss upcoming campaigns, and backend engineers could flag potential performance concerns</strong>. It was fascinating to see how brand-consistency discussions mingled seamlessly with talk of data models and API endpoints. By fostering this interdepartmental understanding, we avoided unexpected pitfalls and allowed each release cycle to flow more smoothly.

## Collecting User Insights (Without Sacrificing Performance)
Understanding user behavior was paramount. We wanted detailed analytics for iterative improvements, but we also recognized the importance of keeping the site fast and users’ data safe. Working with the UX and marketing teams, I helped lay out a tracking strategy that captured key metrics—like form completion rates and time on page—without weighing down the user experience.

One particular breakthrough involved embedding lightweight tracking scripts directly within our component library. That way, we automatically collected usage data on critical UI elements without repetitive code. This approach cut out redundancies and kept load times snappy—an essential factor for an insurance platform where trust and efficiency go hand in hand.

## Empowering Content and Marketing Teams
From my experience at other companies, I knew marketers and content creators often get bottlenecked when they rely too heavily on engineers. So, part of our design system overhaul included building simple yet robust ways for these teams to run campaigns and adjust site content without writing a single line of code.

I remember the first time a marketing manager excitedly told me she’d just launched a new landing page variant entirely on her own—and it didn’t break anything! Moments like that validated our user-centric design decisions. By giving non-developers more independence, we freed up engineering resources to tackle bigger technical challenges, improving overall velocity.

## Standardizing the UI with Accessibility in Mind
Of course, a design system isn’t complete without a strong commitment to accessibility. <strong>We approached each component—from buttons and form fields to navigation bars—with a set of guidelines that included color contrast, keyboard navigation, and ARIA labels.</strong> Collaborating with QA and using tools like Storybook, we documented every element so developers would know exactly how to integrate them while meeting accessibility standards.

The payoff was immediate: <strong>we saw fewer support tickets about confusing layouts, and user feedback indicated that people found the site easier to navigate</strong>. Making accessibility part of our development DNA also aligned perfectly with our mission as an insurance provider—ensuring everyone, regardless of ability, could confidently explore and manage their policies online.

## The Lasting Impact
Looking back, <strong>the design system we built at Berxi.com did far more than just unify colors and styles. It created a shared language that developers, marketers, and product managers could all speak</strong>. It empowered content creators to work autonomously, spurred efficient user tracking without harming site performance, and embedded accessibility into every component.

For me, the greatest satisfaction came from witnessing how quickly a new feature could go from idea to deployment when everyone was aligned around a single, flexible framework. By placing accessibility, collaboration, and developer experience at the forefront, we positioned Berxi.com as a forward-thinking player in the digital insurance space—one that isn’t afraid to innovate, iterate, and place user experience at the heart of everything we do.

This journey has reinforced my belief that design systems are more than just a collection of components. They’re a philosophy for how teams can build products smarter, faster, and more empathetically. And at Berxi.com, we proved that when done right, these systems can fuel both business growth and exceptional user experiences, setting a strong foundation for the future.
