        </PageHeader>
        <p>
          I build digital experiences that are both good-looking and good-hearted. For over twenty years I've been the person behind the buttons you mash, the forms you fill out, and the little UI details that make websites feel less like machines and more like places you want to be. I love the sweet spot where design meets code, turning pixels and logic into something people actually enjoy using.

        <h2 id="tools" class="text-3xl">Tools of the Trade</h2>
        <p>I work with many of the modern front-end staples such as Vue, React, and their ecosystems, which I think of as different sets of building blocks. CSS is where I really feel at home, whether that means writing it plain, structuring it with Sass, or moving quickly with utility classes in Tailwind. I have also spent time with Ruby on Rails, which feels a bit like knowing how the plumbing and wiring run behind the walls.</p>
        <p>At the end of the day, tools are just tools. What matters to me is how they are used: starting with a clear plan, building on a solid foundation, testing to make sure everything works the way it should, and making it accessible so that everyone can use it. That is the part that lasts long after frameworks and libraries come and go.</p>
